## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `pytest`, note: you may need to install `pytest` first.
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
5. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
6. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
7. Pat yourself on the back :) and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the PEP8 [style guide][style].
- Write and update tests.
- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
